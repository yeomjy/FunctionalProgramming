# Assignment 2: Programming Principles, SNU 4190.210

## Restrictions

1. Do not use keyword `var`. Use `val` and `def` instead.
2. From now on, you can use some classes in `scala.collections.*` (except `scala.collections.mutable.*`) and basic APIs in `String` and `Char` classes. Also you can make your custom case classes.
3. DO NOT USE builtin regex matcher of Java or Scala API. The core algorithm should be derived by your hand.

## Q&A
