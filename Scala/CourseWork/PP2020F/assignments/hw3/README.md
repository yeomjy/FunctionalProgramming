# Assignment 3: Programming Principles, SNU 4190.210

## Restrictions

1. Do not use keyword `var`. Use `val` and `def` instead.
2. You can use some classes in `scala.collections.*` (except `scala.collections.mutable.*`) and basic APIs in `String` and `Char` classes. You cannot use data structures in `scala.*` except primitive types (like `Int`, `Float`, ...), `Option`, and `Either`. Also you can make your custom case classes.

## Q&A
